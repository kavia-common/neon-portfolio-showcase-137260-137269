# Lightweight React Template for KAVIA

This project provides a minimal React template with a clean, modern UI and minimal dependencies.

## Supabase Realtime Contact Form

This template integrates a Supabase-backed contact form with realtime inserts.

Setup:
1) Install dependencies (already in package.json after running npm install):
   - @supabase/supabase-js

2) Create a `.env` file at the project root (same folder as package.json), based on `.env.example`:
   - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=
   - REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=

3) In your Supabase project, create a table named `contact_messages` (SQL example):
```sql
create table if not exists public.contact_messages (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text not null,
  message text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```
Enable Realtime for this table in the Supabase dashboard (Database -> Replication -> configure -> enable for `contact_messages`).

The form will insert rows to `public.contact_messages` and a small realtime feed on the Contact section will show last inserted messages live.

## Features

- **Lightweight**: No heavy UI frameworks - uses only vanilla CSS and React
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive design with KAVIA brand styling
- **Fast**: Minimal dependencies for quick loading times
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and modify

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Customization

### Colors

The main brand colors are defined as CSS variables in `src/App.css`:

```css
:root {
  --kavia-orange: #E87A41;
  --kavia-dark: #1A1A1A;
  --text-color: #ffffff;
  --text-secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);
  --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

### Components

This template uses pure HTML/CSS components instead of a UI framework. You can find component styles in `src/App.css`. 

Common components include:
- Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-large`)
- Container (`.container`)
- Navigation (`.navbar`)
- Typography (`.title`, `.subtitle`, `.description`)
