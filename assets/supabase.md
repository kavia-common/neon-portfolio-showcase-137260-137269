# Supabase Integration Notes

This frontend uses a client-side Supabase connection for a realtime contact form.

Environment variables (must be provided via deployment environment or local .env):
- REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL
- REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY

Do NOT hardcode keys in the codebase. The React app reads these variables at build time.

Contact messages table schema (example):
```sql
create table if not exists public.contact_messages (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text not null,
  message text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

Realtime:
- The Contact component subscribes to INSERT events on `public.contact_messages` and displays the last few messages.
- Ensure Realtime is enabled for the `contact_messages` table in Supabase (Database -> Replication).

Email redirect (if using Supabase Auth for signup flows):
- Use an environment variable for app URL, e.g., REACT_APP_SITE_URL, and pass to `emailRedirectTo` as needed.

Security:
- Keep the service role key out of the client. Use the anon public key for client-side apps.
- For anything beyond simple inserts or requiring RLS bypass, a backend should be used.
